# Hands-on Exercises

These exercises provide a hands-on understanding of Git and cover various aspects of version control, from basic concepts to collaborative workflows.

- Form groups of 2 to 5 people.
- If you don't have a GitHub (<https://github.com>) account, create one.
- Share your github ID with the group.



## Exercise 1: Installing Git
- Install Git on your computer and verify the installation with the `git --version` command. \[optional\]
- Login to JupyterLab on ARC or via SSH, check git version.

## Exercise 2: Initializing a Git Repository
- Create a new directory, navigate to it, and use `git init` to initialize a Git repository.

## Exercise 3: Making Commits
- Create a new file, make changes to it, and use `git add` and `git commit` to commit those changes to the repository.

## Exercise 4: Viewing Commit History
- Use `git log` to display the commit history of the repository.

## Exercise 5: Creating Branches
- Create a new branch using `git branch` and switch to that branch with `git checkout`.

## Exercise 6: Merging Branches
- Make changes in a branch, commit them, and then merge the changes into the main branch using `git merge`.

## Exercise 7: Resolving Merge Conflicts
- Create a merge conflict intentionally, and resolve it using a text editor.

## Exercise 8: Remote Repositories and Cloning
- clone a remote repository using `git clone`.

## Exercise 9: Pushing and Pulling
- Make changes, commit them, and then push those changes to the remote repository.
- Ask group members to pull changes made by others.

## Exercise 10: Collaborative Workflow
- Work as a group:
    - One person makes changes, commits, and pushes,
    - the other pulls those changes and resolves any conflicts.
- Swap roles and repeat the process.
